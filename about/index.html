<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Rys Rabang!</h1>
	<p>I am an aspiring software developer, looking for more opportunities to learn! <br/>
  I started off my education at UBC, majoring in Psychology of Arts. Quickly realizing that <br/>
  I did not want to continue in Psychology, my brother recommended me to try Computer Science. <br/>
  Willing to try anything, I enrolled in a Computer Science course and fell in love. Since I was almost finished <br/>
  my Psychology degree, my parents wanted me to finish it before I would go on to study Computer System Technology at BCIT. <br/>
  The rest is all recent history.</p>
